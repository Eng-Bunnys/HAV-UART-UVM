# Hardware-Assisted Verification â€“ UART with UVM

**HAV UART UVM** is a hardware-assisted verification environment for a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) using the **UVM (Universal Verification Methodology)** framework.  
The project demonstrates how FPGA acceleration can be leveraged to speed up simulation and enable large-scale regression testing.

---

##  Overview

This project showcases:

- A synthesizable UART DUT (Device Under Test)
- UVM-based testbench architecture for modular and reusable verification components
- Integration with a hardware acceleration backend for faster simulation (conceptual/emulated in this version)
- Example constrained-random stimulus and functional coverage collection
- Self-checking testbench with scoreboarding
- Basic FPGA mapping flow (for demonstration purposes)

##  How to Run

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Eng-Bunnys/HAV-UART-UVM.git
cd HAV-UART-UVM
````

### 2. Build & Run Simulation

```bash
make sim
```

### 3. (Optional) Run Hardware-Assisted Mode

> This step requires access to supported FPGA acceleration hardware and tools.

```bash
make hwassist
```
